# Exercise 3: Buffers and Tabs

## buffers

open new buffer in horizontal split with `:split {file_name}` 

## moving between buffers

focus right buffer <C-w>l 
focus left buffer <C-w>h 
focus buffer below <C-w>j 
focus buffer above <C-w>k

## manipulating buffers

move current buffer to left <C-w>H
move current buffer to right <C-w>L
move current buffer to down <C-w>J
move current buffer to up <C-w>K

rotate of buffers <C-w>r

close all buffers except focused one <C-w>o

## see all opened buffers by typing `:ls` in command mode and type `:b {buffer_id or file_name}` to go to that file.

## more info: `:help buffers`
